Inspired by c# Moq library.\nDocumentation https://dvabuzyarov.github.io/moq.ts/\nImportant\nThis implementation depends on Proxy object.\nSo if your production code is not compatible with this I would recommend you separate you production code and testing code into dedicated projects.\nIf you need help with this then ask me.\nInstall\nnpm install moq.ts --save-dev\nQuick start\nmoq.ts as the original Moq library is intended to be simple to use, strongly typed (no magic strings!, and therefore full compiler-verified and refactoring-friendly) and minimalistic (while still fully functional!).\nYou can find a pretty full set of usages in the integration tests. Check out tests.integration folder.\nMocking property of objects\n-\nmock-get.property.IntegrationTests.ts\nimport {Mock, It, Times, ExpectedGetPropertyExpression} from 'moq.ts';\ninterface ITestObject {\n    property1: number;\n    property2: number;\n    property3: number;\n    property4: number;\n    method(): void;\n}\n\nconst property4Name = 'property4';\nconst mockName = 'mock name is optional';\nconst mock = new Mock(mockName)\n    .setup(instance => instance.property1)\n    .returns(1)\n\n    .setup(instance => It.Is((expression: ExpectedGetPropertyExpression) => expression.name === 'property2'))\n    .returns(100)\n\n    //let's deny any write operation on the property for all values\n    .setup(instance => {instance.property2 = It.Is(() => true)})\n    .returns(false)\n\n    .setup(instance => instance.property3)\n    .callback(()=> 10 + 10)\n\n    .setup(instance => instance[property4Name])\n    .throws(new Error('property4 access'))\n\n    //since a method is a property that holds a pointer to a function\n    .setup(instance => instance.method)\n    .returns(()=>{console.log('The method was called')});\n\nconst object = mock.object();\nobject.method();\n\nmock.verify(instance=> instance.property1, Times.Never());Mocking property setting\n-\nThe documentation on returned value from 'set hook' on Proxy object\nmock-set.property.IntegrationTests.ts\nimport {Mock, It, Times, ExpectedSetPropertyExpression} from 'moq.ts';\ninterface ITestObject {\n    property: number|any;\n}\n\nconst value = {field: new Date()};\n\nconst mock = new Mock()\n    .setup(instance => {instance.property = 1})\n    //true - allows the write operation\n    .returns(true)\n\n    .setup(instance => It.Is((expression: ExpectedSetPropertyExpression) => expression.name === 'property' && expression.value === 2))\n    //false - denies the write operation\n    .returns(false)\n\n    .setup(instance => {instance.property = It.Is(value => value === 3)})\n    // allows the write operation\n    .callback(()=> true)\n\n    .setup(instance => {instance.property = value})\n    .throws(new Error('an object has been written into property'));\n\n\nconst object = mock.object();\nobject.property = 1;\n\nmock.verify(instance=> {instance.property = 1}, Times.Once());Mocking functions\n-\nmock-method.property.IntegrationTests.ts\nimport {Mock, It, Times} from 'moq.ts';\ninterface ITestFunction {\n    (arg: number|any): string;\n}\n\nconst value = {field: new Date()};\n\nconst mock = new Mock()\n    .setup(instance => instance(1))\n    .returns('called with 1')\n\n    .setup(instance => instance(2))\n    .callback((argument)=> argument === 2 ?
